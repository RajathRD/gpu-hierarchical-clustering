1. Improve CPU version to n^2 long n or n^2 
2. GPU get pairwise min parallel reduction
3. Merging/updating matrices

4. Testing/Validation - till GPU runs out of memory
5. Improvements

Tasks:
- DONE: Fix issues for these:
    ./single_gpu_clustering 7 1 1
    ./single_gpu_clustering 10 1 1
    ./single_gpu_clustering 7 2 1

- TODO: Update arg checks for 4 inputs as well as for tests
- TODO: Add tester in a separate file with sample tests for GPU version

Notes:
- There are 3 cuda memory (cudaMalloc with int and float types) allocations so, total memory needed is 4*(2*n*n + n*m). 
    Sine single device memory is 60GB, n should be tested as much as 120000 before hitting memory limits.
